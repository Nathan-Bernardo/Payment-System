# Payment System with Braintree
In my internship at AdLauncher, I used the Braintree API to develop a payment system for our website.  The tools I used during my internship are:
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/)

# Why Braintree?
The cmopany wanted to have a subscription-based membership system for our product, and Braintree was one of the only payment processing softwares that provided that feature.

# Overall Impression
I'm a student at UCI studying Electrical Engineering and I never took any computer science classes gave me a foundation in algorithm and web development. Even though this internship was only a month due to the unfortunate decision of closing all operations, I came out with a large appreciation with web development.  In this one month, I was able to:
* Use Django to build the backend for the payment system with the Braintree API.
* Demostrate [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete).
* Use Javascript and HTML to build the frontend for the payment system.
* Work with one member tomigrate both the frontend and backend code.
* Work with Object-Oriented Programming.

Before getting thisinternship I had to design my own website within three weeks,and I had no prior experience in web development. The following pages needed the following things:
* Landing Page
* Registerationg Process
* Dashboard

After much suffering, I was able to design my first website and get the internship :)
